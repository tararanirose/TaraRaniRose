            	<h1>About me</h1>
                <p class="standfirst">My name is Samantha Rani Fisher. I am a fully qualified beauty therapist and insured at ABT with 5 years experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work mobile and travel to Scunthorpe, Winterton, Ashby, Bottesford, Messingham, Kirten Lindsey, Brigg and surrounding areas. I am willing to travel further providing travel and expenses are paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I trained for 2 years at North Lindsey College, Scunthorpe and went on to work at Forest Pines Hotel &amp; Spa for 1 year. This gave me fantastic training in Elemis facials and body massage. My mobile business started in March 2008 and has steadily been building up since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My aim is to provide a professional and affordable treatment in the comfort of your own home. Treatments range from bridal makeup to waxing, massage, manicures, pedicures and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have a browse through this website and I will look forward to your call for that special pamper session. Please note if you have any enquiries I will be more than happy to assist you.
